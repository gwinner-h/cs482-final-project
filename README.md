This project is the code I wrote to contribute to our final project in CS-482: Machine Learning.
logScraper.py is the code used to scrape the Pokemon Showdown database 
for log files (approximately ~6400 files), allowing 
dataParser.py to iterate through each file and retrieve particular data chosen to be 
used in training multiple machine learning models. 

The models use the data chosen to predict the outcome of a match, given the
conditions used by a player. The models are coded by Dylan Lozon, which are not included
in this project repository currently.
